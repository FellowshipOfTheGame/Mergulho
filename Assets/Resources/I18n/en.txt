instructions0=\n- The WASD keys or the arrow keys move the diver.\n\n- To interact with objects, use the left mouse button.
instructions1=\n- Collect the keys, it is only with them that you can open the chests\n\n- Open a chest to answer a question and win the photo.\n\n- Read carefully! Your mistakes cost compressed air.
instructions2=\n- Click on the album icon to see the photos collected.\n\n- To view your photo more closely, click on the magnifying glass!
instructions3=\n- Your compressed air is consumed over time.\n\n- As deeper you are, as faster the air is spent, so be careful!\n\n- See how deep you are checking the depth gauge.
instructions4=\n- Collect the bubbles to gain an air bonus.\n\n- If a shark appears, run away! They will make your air end quickly.

customtitle=Prepare the diver!
customwarning0=Ops! Still missing equipment...
customwarning1=A safe dive can not be done that way.
skintone=Skin Tone
equipments=Equipments
play=Play
divingmask=Diving mask
divingmaskdesc=The function of the diving mask is to allow the diver to see the bottom of the sea. The layer of air between the front glass of the mask and the eyes of the diver allows the diver to focus the image, which cannot be done with the eyes directly in contact with the water. Due to the effect of refraction, the objects viewed by the diver appear larger and closer than they are in reality.
snorkel=Snorkel
snorkeldesc=Is a tube with 30-40 cm in length and connected to a mouthpiece that allows the diver to breathe when the head is in the water. It is used in the free diving and also in the autonomous diving, in the latter case leading to the economy of the air of the diving cylinder.
regulator=SCUBA Regulator
regulatordesc=Instrument that allows breathing underwater. Its function is to reduce the pressure of the air coming from the diving cylinder, making it breathable.
octopus=Octopus
octopusdesc=Alternative source of air, used only in cases of emergency and malfunction of the SCUBA regulator.
depthmeter=Depth meter
depthmeterdesc=Instrument that indicates the depth at which the diver is.
manometer=Manometer
manometerdesc=Instrument that points the air pressure contained in the cylinder, indicating to the diver how much air is still to be used.
neoprenecloth=Neoprene clothing
neopreneclothdesc=Prevents heat loss from the diver's body and also protects against possible scratches and burns.
compressedair=Compressed Air Cylinder
compressedairdesc=Typically built in steel, stores the air that will be used by the autonomous diver during the dive.\nContrary to what many people think, it contains not only oxygen, but the same composition of the air we breathe (21% O2, 79% N2).
bcd=Buoyancy control device (BCD)
bcddesc=Vest that can be inflated with air and allows the diver to control their buoyancy.
ballast=Ballast
ballastdesc=Ballast weights to control the buoyancy of the diver so that it is possible to sink to the desired depth and to remain at this depth from the controlled infill of the BCD (neutral buoyancy).
fins=Fins
finsdesc=The movement of the legs is responsible for the diver's movement (the arms are not used to swim during the dive).\nDepending on the size and width, the fins will provide different speeds to the diver.
knife=Diving knife
knifedesc=Dive Safety Item.
